# 8queen-murphi

### Usage

```bash
[out_file] -ndl -m [sufficiently large memory size]
```
ex.
```bash
8queen.out -ndl -m 8000
```

### Note

* by default it prints all solutions to the 8-queen problem
* uncomment the last two lines in 8queen.m to print only the first found solution (as a showcase of Murphi's state assertion capability)
